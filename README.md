# Firebase onAuthStateChanged Listener Inconsistency

This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase's `onAuthStateChanged` listener: it might not reliably fire when the user's authentication status changes while the application is in the background or terminated. This can lead to unexpected behavior, especially when the app depends on the listener to update the UI or data based on the user's login status.

The `authBug.js` file shows how the problem manifests, while `authSolution.js` presents a potential solution.

## Problem
The main problem is that the Firebase SDK's state updates might not immediately trigger the `onAuthStateChanged` callback if they occur while the app isn't active.

## Solution
The solution presented in `authSolution.js` involves persisting the user's authentication status to local storage. This way, when the app is relaunched, it can check the stored status and reflect it in the UI or other app behaviors until a reliable update from `onAuthStateChanged` is available.
